## Usage
Core Services has a lot of APIs. Each category of API has its own client object so that interfaces are kept tight and simple.

### Instantiating a Client
You need to provide a valid apiUser and apiKey that is registered with Core Services. You must also specify the environment you want to connect to using one of the constants from the gosdks config package.

```
client := BuildTaxonomyClient("myApiUser", "myApiKey", config.Test)
```

### Validation Rules & Utilities

```golang
v := validation.NewValidator()

v.Rule(cssdk.TaxonomyIDValidationRule(cssdkClient, ctx, taxIDs, util.InvalidArgument, "Invalid Taxonomy ID"))
```
