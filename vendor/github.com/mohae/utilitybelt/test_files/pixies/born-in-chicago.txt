I was born in Chicago
1971
I was born in Chicago 1970
What my father told me,
"Son, you'd better get a gun."
My first friend went down
When I was 16 years old
Oh my first friend went down
When I was 16 years old
There's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta go
My second friend went down
When I was 17 years of age
Oh my second friend went down
When I was 17 years of age
There's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta pray
Oh life is a lie
If you don't know how to play the game
Oh life is a lie
If you don't know how to play the game
All my friends are going
And everything's gonna stay the same
