I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg, or to borrow
A woman
With the feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming for me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
A woman
With the feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming for me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
