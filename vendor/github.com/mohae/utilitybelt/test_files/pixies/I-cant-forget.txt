I stumbled out of bed
I got ready for the struggle
I smoked a cigarette
And I tightened up my gut
I said this can't be me
Must be my double
And I can't forget
And I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what
I'm burning up the road
I'm heading down to Phoenix
I got this old address
Of someone that I knew
It was high and fine and free
Oh you should've seen us
And I can't forget
And I can't forget
Ican't forget but I don't remember who
I'll be there today with a big bouquet of cactus
I've got this rig that runs, runs on memory
And I promise, cross my heart they'll never catch us
But if they do just tell 'em it was me
I've loved you all my life
And that's how I want to end it
The summer's almost gone
And winter's tuning up
The summer's gone but a lot goes on forever
And I can't forget
I can't forget
I can't forget, but I don't remember what
